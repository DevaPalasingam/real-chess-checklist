# Real Chess Checklist

A tool to help you play better chess. The idea behind this project is based on a concept called "Real Chess".
This was a term coined by Dan Heisman that he describes in a Chess Cafe article.

## How to use this tool to improve your chess

Obviously in real games, you're not allowed to use a tool like this. Plus this tool would be totally useless for blitz/rapid games.
The flow of the checklist is pretty straightforward.
But often the hangup for most beginners is being disciplined enough to actually sit down and slowly think through every move of the game.

Here is my recommendation:

- Use this tool while playing _slow practice games_ or while doing _tactics puzzles_
- Try to force yourself to go through all the steps **every move**, even the seemingly obvious ones

It will definitly feel rigid and boring at first. But if you're really disciplined about it, it will make your games much more consistent.
